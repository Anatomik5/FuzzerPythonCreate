# FuzzerPythonCreate
Here I want to start my open sourced fuzzer, so I can develop my own fully working fuzzer for Python -> than to adapt it for C
Now I am in first phase:

First phase:
1) Simple Mutator and fuzzer for array of integers
2) I use coverage.py from other people, but in future I will write it by myself
